> ? SEC_TO_TIME
Name: 'SEC_TO_TIME'
Description:
Syntax:
SEC_TO_TIME(seconds)

Returns the seconds argument, converted to hours, minutes, and seconds,
as a TIME value. The range of the result is constrained to that of the
TIME data type. A warning occurs if the argument corresponds to a value
outside that range.

URL: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/date-and-time-functions.html

Examples:
mysql> SELECT SEC_TO_TIME(2378);
        -> '00:39:38'
mysql> SELECT SEC_TO_TIME(2378) + 0;
        -> 3938

Name: 'SHOW'
Description:
SHOW has many forms that provide information about databases, tables,
columns, or status information about the server. This section describes
those following:

SHOW AUTHORS
SHOW {BINARY | MASTER} LOGS
SHOW BINLOG EVENTS [IN 'log_name'] [FROM pos] [LIMIT [offset,] row_count]
SHOW CHARACTER SET [like_or_where]
SHOW COLLATION [like_or_where]
SHOW [FULL] COLUMNS FROM tbl_name [FROM db_name] [like_or_where]
SHOW CONTRIBUTORS
SHOW CREATE DATABASE db_name
SHOW CREATE EVENT event_name
SHOW CREATE FUNCTION func_name
SHOW CREATE PROCEDURE proc_name
SHOW CREATE TABLE tbl_name
SHOW CREATE TRIGGER trigger_name
SHOW CREATE VIEW view_name
SHOW DATABASES [like_or_where]
SHOW ENGINE engine_name {STATUS | MUTEX}
SHOW [STORAGE] ENGINES
SHOW ERRORS [LIMIT [offset,] row_count]
SHOW EVENTS
SHOW FUNCTION CODE func_name
SHOW FUNCTION STATUS [like_or_where]
SHOW GRANTS FOR user
SHOW INDEX FROM tbl_name [FROM db_name]
SHOW MASTER STATUS
SHOW OPEN TABLES [FROM db_name] [like_or_where]
SHOW PLUGINS
SHOW PROCEDURE CODE proc_name
SHOW PROCEDURE STATUS [like_or_where]
SHOW PRIVILEGES
SHOW [FULL] PROCESSLIST
SHOW PROFILE [types] [FOR QUERY n] [OFFSET n] [LIMIT n]
SHOW PROFILES
SHOW SLAVE HOSTS
SHOW SLAVE STATUS
SHOW [GLOBAL | SESSION] STATUS [like_or_where]
SHOW TABLE STATUS [FROM db_name] [like_or_where]
SHOW [FULL] TABLES [FROM db_name] [like_or_where]
SHOW TRIGGERS [FROM db_name] [like_or_where]
SHOW [GLOBAL | SESSION] VARIABLES [like_or_where]
SHOW WARNINGS [LIMIT [offset,] row_count]

like_or_where:
    LIKE 'pattern'
  | WHERE expr

If the syntax for a given SHOW statement includes a LIKE 'pattern'
part, 'pattern' is a string that can contain the SQL "%" and "_"
wildcard characters. The pattern is useful for restricting statement
output to matching values.

Several SHOW statements also accept a WHERE clause that provides more
flexibility in specifying which rows to display. See
