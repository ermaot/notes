## 1.isalnum（是否为英文或者数字）

检查单个字符是否是英文或者数字，等同于isalpha(c)  || isnum(c)，在<ctype.h>头文件中

```
#include<ctype.h>
#include<stdio.h>
int main(void){
        char str [] ="123456abcdef@#FDsp[?;'";
        int i = 0;
        for(i=0;str[i] !=0;i++)
        {
                if(isalnum(str[i])) printf("%c is an alphabetic character\n",str[i]);
        }
}
```

输出结果

```
1 is an alphabetic character
2 is an alphabetic character
3 is an alphabetic character
4 is an alphabetic character
5 is an alphabetic character
6 is an alphabetic character
a is an alphabetic character
b is an alphabetic character
c is an alphabetic character
d is an alphabetic character
e is an alphabetic character
f is an alphabetic character
F is an alphabetic character
D is an alphabetic character
s is an alphabetic character
p is an alphabetic character
```



## 2.isalpha

```

#include<ctype.h>
#include<stdio.h>
int main(void){
        char str [] ="123456abcdef@#FDsp[?;'";
        int i = 0;
        for(i=0;str[i] !='\0';i++)
        {
                if(isalpha(str[i])) printf("%c is an alphabetic character\n",str[i]);
        }
}
```

输出结果

```

c is an alphabetic character
d is an alphabetic character
e is an alphabetic character
f is an alphabetic character
F is an alphabetic character

#include<stdio.h>
int main(void){
        char str [] ="123456abcdef@#FDsp[?;'";
        int i = 0;
        for(i=0;str[i] !='\0';i++)
        {
                if(isascii(str[i])) printf("%c is an ascii character,and ascii num is %d\n",str[i],str[i]);
        }
}
```

        char str [] ="123456abcde f@#   FDsp[?;'";
        int i = 0;
        for(i=0;str[i] !='\0';i++)
        {
                if(isblank(str[i])) printf("%c is an ascii character,and ascii num is %d\n",str[i],str[i]);
        }
}
```

输出结果

```
  is an ascii character,and ascii num is 32
	 is an ascii character,and ascii num is 9
```



## 5.iscntrl

检查参数是否ascii码在1到9之间。宏定义，非真实函数

        char str [] ="123456abcde f@#   FD\vsp\f[?\n;'";
        int i = 0;
        for(i=0;str[i] !='\0';i++)
        {
                if(islower(str[i])) printf("%c is a lower character,and ascii num is %d\n",str[i],str[i]);

```
#include<ctype.h>
#include<stdio.h>
int main(void){
        char str [] ="123456abcde f@#   FDsp[?;'";
        int i = 0;
        for(i=0;str[i] !='\0';i++)
        {
                if(isprint(str[i])) printf("%c is a printable character,and ascii num is %d\n",str[i],str[i]);
        }

可见与isgraph的区别在于，字符为空格的时候isgraph()返回false而isprint()返回true

## 10.isspace

```
#include<ctype.h>
#include<stdio.h>
int main(void){
        char str [] ="123456abcde f@#   FD\vsp\f[?\n;'";
        int i = 0;
        for(i=0;str[i] !='\0';i++)
        {
                if(isspace(str[i])) printf("%c is a printable character,and ascii num is %d\n",str[i],str[i]);
        }
}
```

输出结果

```
  is a printable character,and ascii num is 32
	 is a printable character,and ascii num is 9

 is a printable character,and ascii num is 11

 is a printable character,and ascii num is 12

 is a printable character,and ascii num is 10
```

可以看到tab也被认为是space

## 11.ispunct

测试是否为标点或者特殊符号

```
#include<ctype.h>
#include<stdio.h>
int main(void){
        char str [] ="123456abcde f@#   FD\vsp\f[?\n;'";
        int i = 0;
        for(i=0;str[i] !='\0';i++)
        {
                if(ispunct(str[i])) printf("%c is a lower character,and ascii num is %d\n",str[i],str[i]);
        }
}
```

输出结果

```
@ is a lower character,and ascii num is 64
# is a lower character,and ascii num is 35
[ is a lower character,and ascii num is 91
? is a lower character,and ascii num is 63
; is a lower character,and ascii num is 59
' is a lower character,and ascii num is 39
```



## 12.isupper

```
#include<ctype.h>
#include<stdio.h>
int main(void){
        char str [] ="123456abcde f@#   FD\vsp\f[?\n;'";
        int i = 0;
        for(i=0;str[i] !='\0';i++)
        {
                if(isupper(str[i])) printf("%c is a lower character,and ascii num is %d\n",str[i],str[i]);
        }
}
```

输出结果

```
F is a lower character,and ascii num is 70
D is a lower character,and ascii num is 68
```



## 13.isxdigit

是否为16进制数字（即是否是1~10，a~f，A~F）

```
#include<ctype.h>
#include<stdio.h>
int main(void){
        char str [] ="123456abcde f@#   FD\vsp\f[?\n;'";
        int i = 0;
        for(i=0;str[i] !='\0';i++)
        {
                if(isxdigit(str[i])) printf("%c is a lower character,and ascii num is %d\n",str[i],str[i]);
        }
}
```

输出结果

```
1 is a lower character,and ascii num is 49
2 is a lower character,and ascii num is 50
3 is a lower character,and ascii num is 51

5 is a lower character,and ascii num is 53
6 is a lower character,and ascii num is 54
a is a lower character,and ascii num is 97
b is a lower character,and ascii num is 98
c is a lower character,and ascii num is 99
d is a lower character,and ascii num is 100
e is a lower character,and ascii num is 101
f is a lower character,and ascii num is 102
F is a lower character,and ascii num is 70
